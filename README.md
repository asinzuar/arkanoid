# Arkanoid

This is an implementation of the old Arkanoid NES video game using Java Swing, done by me as a weekend project back in college around 2013.
I actually lost the original source code but luckily found the runnable JAR lying around in an old USB drive. These sources were obtained by decompiling the .class files.
